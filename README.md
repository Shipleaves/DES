This is a disconnected, distributed computing project that I have set up with some classmates to help me break a DES cipher for a school assignment. Our instructor reduced the key space to 2^36 to make it feasible to accomplish in a week's time, but we still need tons of help! The key space has been divided into 1000 segments, each one containing about 68 million keys. A segment will take about 2 hours on a computer that can computer 10,000 keys per second. There is a google spreadsheet with all of the segments that have been or are currently being searched, please check there before starting the program! When launched the program will prompt the user for which segment they want to start at and how many segments they want to check, upon completion it will list which segments you checked and output a unique hash for that segment (to prevent and detect vandalism of the public spreadsheet). If you are lucky enough to find the key, a special message will print to the console and a text file will appear in the same directory as the executable with the key in it, please send this to me if you find it! Thanks for coming to help or to just check out the project :)

We did it everyone! Someone found the key in segment 458 and we have successfully decrypted the cipher text that was given. Thanks for all the help and huge shoutouts to all who participated, we had some great participation and a ton of fun in the process.
